## Code-of-condum

Welcome to our project! We are thrilled to have you contribute. However, to ensure a harmonious and productive environment, we have established the following Code of Conduct. Please read it carefully, as it is both extensive and detailed. Adherence to this Code is mandatory for all contributors, and failure to comply may result in severe consequences, including but not limited to temporary or permanent removal from the project.
1. General Principles

1.1 Respect and Dignity: All contributors must treat each other with the utmost respect and dignity. Disparaging remarks, condescension, or any form of belittlement will not be tolerated.

1.2 Inclusivity: Our project is committed to inclusivity. Contributors must actively avoid any language or behavior that could be construed as exclusionary or discriminatory based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other characteristic.

1.3 Communication: All communication must be conducted in a professional manner. Contributors are required to use complete sentences, proper grammar, and punctuation in all written communications. Texting abbreviations, slang, or informal language are strictly prohibited.
2. Contribution Guidelines

2.1 Pull Requests: All pull requests must include a detailed description of the changes made, the rationale behind them, and a list of potential impacts on existing functionality. Additionally, contributors must provide at least three examples of how the changes improve the project.

2.2 Code Style: Contributors must adhere to the project's coding style guide, which is subject to change without notice. Any deviation from the style guide will result in immediate rejection of the pull request, regardless of the quality of the code.

2.3 Testing: All contributions must include unit tests that cover at least 95% of the new code. Contributors must also provide documentation on how to run the tests, including any dependencies and environment configurations.

2.4 Documentation: Every contribution must be accompanied by comprehensive documentation. This includes, but is not limited to, API documentation, user guides, and inline comments. Documentation must be written in Markdown and follow the project's specific formatting guidelines.
3. Communication Protocols

3.1 Issue Reporting: When reporting issues, contributors must provide a detailed account of the problem, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, and screenshots if applicable. Issues lacking sufficient detail will be closed without further notice.

3.2 Feedback: All feedback must be constructive and delivered in a timely manner. Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback on all contributions, but must do so in a manner that is both respectful and thorough. Vague feedback will not be accepted.

3.3 Meetings: Regular meetings will be held bi-weekly. Attendance is mandatory, and contributors must come prepared with a status update on their contributions. Failure to attend without prior notice will result in a formal warning.
4. Conflict Resolution

4.1 Disputes: In the event of a dispute, contributors must first attempt to resolve the issue privately. If a resolution cannot be reached, the matter must be escalated to a designated mediator, who will review the situation and provide a binding resolution.

4.2 Reporting Violations: Contributors are encouraged to report any violations of this Code of Conduct. Reports must be submitted in writing and include a detailed account of the incident, including date, time, and any witnesses. Anonymous reports will not be accepted.
5. Enforcement

5.1 Consequences: Violations of this Code of Conduct will result in consequences that may include, but are not limited to, temporary suspension, permanent removal from the project, or a formal reprimand. The severity of the consequence will be determined by the project maintainers.

5.2 Appeals: Contributors who wish to appeal a decision made under this Code of Conduct may do so in writing. Appeals must be submitted within 14 days of the decision and must include a detailed explanation of the grounds for the appeal.
6. Amendments

6.1 Changes to the Code: This Code of Conduct is subject to change at any time. Contributors will **not** be notified of any changes via the project's communication channels. Continued participation in the project after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
7. Final Thoughts

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct in its entirety. We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to a productive and respectful collaboration. Thank you for your understanding and commitment to maintaining a positive environment for all contributors.
